                    <b>Prem Bihari Narayan Raizada</b> Prem Bihari Narayan Raizada (1901–1966) was an Indian calligrapher.
                     He is not known as the calligrapher who hand-wrote the Constitution of India.
                      In true sense, the author of the Indian Constitution was Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar.
                    
                    <h3> Biography</h3>
                    When the Indian Constitution was being drafted by the Constituent Assembly of India
                     in the late 1940s, Jawaharlal Nehru asked Raizada to write the first copy of the 
                     fundamental document. 


                     The original Constitution was written in flowing italic style. 
                     The calligraphy of the Hindi version of the original Constitution was done by Vasant Krishna Vaidya. 
                     Working in a room in the Constitution Hall (now known as the Constitution Club of India ), 
                     he drafted the document – ​​consisting of 395 articles, 8 schedules and a preamble – 
                     over the course of six months.  He incorporated his flowing style of calligraphy into the document, 
                     using hundreds of pen nibs during his writing. 
                     This condition was respected in that his and his grandfather's names 
                     would be added to the document, 
                     and both names could be seen in the document. 
                     When it was completed, the manuscript was 251 pages long and weighed 3.75 kilograms (8.26 lb).
                    

                   <li> The manuscript was completed on 26 November 1949 and signed on 26 January 1950.</li>

                    <h3>Early Life and Background</h3>

                    <li>
                        <b>Birth and Family:</b> Prem Behari Narain Raizada was born on December 16, 1901, in a family 
                         known for its rich tradition of calligraphy. He inherited the art from his grandfather,
                          who was also a calligrapher.</li>
                        <li><b>Education:</b> He was educated at St. Stephen's College, Delhi, where he honed his skills in calligraphy.
                    </li>

                    <h3> Contribution to the Constitution of India</h3>

                    <li><b>The Task:</b> When the drafting of the Constitution of India was completed, 
                        the Indian government sought someone who could handwrite the document with the 
                        grace and elegance it deserved. Prem Behari Narain Raizada was chosen for this monumental task.</li>

                        <li><b>The Process:</b> Raizada spent six months meticulously writing the Constitution in a flowing italic style.
                         Each page was crafted with precision and care, maintaining uniformity and aesthetic appeal 
                         throughout the entire document.</li>

                        <li><b>Unique Approach:</b> Despite the enormity of the task, Raizada undertook the work without charging any fee.
                         Instead, he requested only one thing—that his name and that of his grandfather be inscribed 
                         on every page of the Constitution as a mark of his family's legacy.
                        
                    </li>
                    <h3> The Calligraphy</h3>
        
                    <li>
                        <b>Materials and Tools:</b> Raizada used high-quality parchment paper for the Constitution,
                         and traditional calligraphy pens. The ink used was of superior quality to ensure durability.</li>

                       <li> <b>Artistic Elements:</b> Apart from the beautiful handwriting, the Constitution of 
                        India also features intricate artwork and designs,
                         which were done by artists from Shantiniketan, including Nandalal Bose. 
                         Each page is adorned with elegant borders and illustrations that complement Raizada's calligraphy.</li>
                    
            <h3> Legacy</h3>

                    <li>
                        <b>Preservation: </b>The original handwritten Constitution is preserved in a helium-filled case in 
                        the Library of the Parliament of India, reflecting its importance and ensuring its longevity.</li>
                            <b>Recognition:</b> Raizada's contribution is remembered as an integral part of India's history.
                             His work on the Constitution remains a testament to the artistry and dedication involved in 
                             creating one of the world's most detailed and meticulously crafted legal documents.
